    """
    Iterative solver that follows dependency order like solving engineering problems by hand.

    This solver works by:
    1. Using dependency graph to determine the correct solving order
    2. Solving variables one by one in dependency order (just like manual solving)
    3. Preserving units throughout with Pint integration
    4. Verifying each solution with residual checking
    5. Repeating until all unknowns are solved

    This approach mirrors how engineers solve problems by hand: solve what you can
    with what you know, then use those results to solve the next level of dependencies.
