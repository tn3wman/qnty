Please review /Users/tyler/Projects/qnty/src/qnty/variable.py for any optimization, simplification, or maintainability improvements. If you find any areas for improvement you will need to modify the dimension generator /Users/tyler/Projects/qnty/scripts/_3_generate_variables.py and regenerate the dimension file.

Please profile /Users/tyler/Projects/qnty/src/qnty/variable.py and see if there are any other performance improvements that can be made. If there are improvements you will need to modify the dimension generator /Users/tyler/Projects/qnty/scripts/_3_generate_variables.py and regenerate the dimension file.

I previously implemented an automatic solver for an example like this:

    T = T_bar * (1 - U_m)  # Wall Thickness
    d = D - 2 * T  # Inside Diameter

    print(T)
    print(d)

Which would automatically print the solved values for T and d if they were indeed solvable. When working on some optimization, simplification, or maintainability improvements, the auto solver has since been removed. Now there is ._auto_eval_enabled and ._can_auto_eval. Create a way to easily solve for T and d that is not necessarily automatic, but easy like T.solve() or d.solve() or something similar.
