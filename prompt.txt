I have many dunder methods and other non-dunder methods that may call a dunder method or something for comparison/arithmatic in /Users/tyler/Projects/qnty/src/qnty/dimensions/signature.py, /Users/tyler/Projects/qnty/src/qnty/expressions/nodes.py, /Users/tyler/Projects/qnty/src/qnty/problems/composition.py, /Users/tyler/Projects/qnty/src/qnty/quantities/base_qnty.py, and /Users/tyler/Projects/qnty/src/qnty/quantities/field_qnty.py. I'm wondering if this is something that can be thoroughly reviewd and potentially refactored. Please review and determine if any improvements can be made for maintainability, readability, or performance. If you find any issues or areas for improvement, please provide specific suggestions and code examples to illustrate your points.
