    Benefits of using arithmetic mixins:
    
    1. **DRY Principle**: Eliminates duplicate method implementations
    2. **Maintainability**: Changes only need to be made in one place
    3. **Consistency**: All classes use the same arithmetic behavior
    4. **Testing**: Mixins can be unit tested independently
    5. **Extensibility**: New operations can be added to all classes at once
    6. **Documentation**: Behavior is documented in one place
    7. **Performance**: Fast path optimizations benefit all classes
    
    Example of adding a new operation:
    
    ```python
    # Add to ArithmeticDelegationMixin
    def __mod__(self, other):
        return self._get_arithmetic_delegate().__mod__(other)
    ```
    
    This immediately adds modulo support to ALL classes using the mixin!

def migration_strategy():
    """
    Strategy for migrating existing code to use mixins:
    
    1. **Phase 1**: Create mixins (DONE)
    2. **Phase 2**: Refactor one class at a time to use mixins
    3. **Phase 3**: Test each refactored class thoroughly
    4. **Phase 4**: Remove old duplicated methods
    5. **Phase 5**: Add new operations/optimizations to mixins
    
    Migration is safe because:
    - Each class can be migrated independently
    - Behavior remains exactly the same
    - Tests verify compatibility
    - Rollback is simple (remove mixin inheritance)
