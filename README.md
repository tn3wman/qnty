## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**üöß Work in Progress**: Qnty is currently in active development and has not been thoroughly vetted for production engineering calculations. While we strive for accuracy, this library should not be used for critical engineering applications without independent verification.

**üìê Accuracy Notice**: The authors are not responsible or liable for incorrect results, calculation errors, or any consequences arising from the use of this library. Always validate calculations independently using established engineering tools and practices.

**üöÄ Learn from History**: Remember, even NASA's Mars Climate Orbiter had a $327 million oops moment due to unit conversion errors between metric and imperial systems. Don't let your project become the next cautionary tale - double-check everything!

*Use Qnty to help prevent unit errors, but always verify critical calculations through multiple methods.*

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
pip install qnty
# or with Poetry
poetry add qnty
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from qnty import Length, Pressure, Dimensionless
from qnty.variable import FastQuantity
from qnty.units import LengthUnits, PressureUnits

# Type-safe variables with fluent API
beam_length = Length("beam_length")
beam_length.set(100.0).millimeters
print(beam_length)  # beam_length: 100.0 mm

# Convert units effortlessly
length_in_meters = beam_length.quantity.to(LengthUnits.meter)
print(length_in_meters)  # 0.1 m

# High-performance calculations
pressure = FastQuantity(150.0, PressureUnits.psi)
area = FastQuantity(0.5, LengthUnits.meter) * FastQuantity(2.0, LengthUnits.meter)
force = pressure * area  # Automatic dimensional analysis
```

### Engineering Example

```python
from qnty import Length, Pressure

# ASME pressure vessel calculation with mixed units
pressure = Pressure("internal_pressure")
diameter = Length("outer_diameter") 
stress = Pressure("allowable_stress")

# Set values with different units - no manual conversion needed!
pressure.set(2900.75).psi        # Imperial
diameter.set(168.275).millimeters  # Metric
stress.set(137.895).MPa          # SI

# Qnty handles all unit conversions automatically
thickness = (pressure.quantity * diameter.quantity) / (2 * stress.quantity)
print(f"Required thickness: {thickness}")  # Automatically in correct units
```

### Mathematical Equations & Solving

```python
from qnty import Length, Pressure, Dimensionless

# Define engineering variables
T = Length("Wall Thickness", is_known=False)  # Unknown to solve for
T_bar = Length(0.147, "inches", "Nominal Wall Thickness")
U_m = Dimensionless(0.125, "Mill Undertolerance")

# Create equation using fluent API: T = T_bar * (1 - U_m)
equation = T.equals(T_bar * (1 - U_m))

# Solve automatically
known_vars = {"T_bar": T_bar, "U_m": U_m}
result = equation.solve_for("T", known_vars)
print(f"Solved thickness: {result.quantity}")  # 0.128625 inches

# Verify equation is satisfied
assert equation.check_residual(known_vars) is True
```

## üß™ Advanced Features

### Fluent API Design

```python
# Method chaining for readable code
pipe_system = {
    'inlet': Pressure("inlet").set(150.0).psi,
    'outlet': Pressure("outlet").set(120.0).psi,
    'diameter': Length("diameter").set(6.0).inches,
    'length': Length("length").set(100.0).feet
}

pressure_drop = pipe_system['inlet'].quantity - pipe_system['outlet'].quantity
```

### Dimensional Safety

```python
# This will raise a TypeError at assignment time
length = Length("distance")
try:
    length.set(100.0).psi  # Wrong! Pressure unit for length variable
except TypeError as e:
    print(f"Caught error: {e}")  # Unit psi incompatible with expected dimension

# Type checker catches this at development time
```

### Mixed Unit Calculations

```python
# Automatically handles unit conversions in calculations
width = Length("width").set(100.0).millimeters
height = Length("height").set(4.0).inches  # Different unit!

# Qnty automatically converts to compatible units
area = width.quantity * height.quantity
perimeter = 2 * (width.quantity + height.quantity)
```

### Equation Solving System

```python
from qnty import Length, Pressure, Dimensionless

# Multi-variable engineering equations
P = Pressure(90, "psi", "P")  # Known
D = Length(0.84, "inches", "D")  # Known
t = Length("t", is_known=False)  # Unknown - solve for this
S = Pressure(20000, "psi", "S")  # Known

# ASME pressure vessel equation: P = (S * t) / ((D/2) + 0.6*t)
# Rearranged to solve for t
equation = t.equals((P * D) / (2 * S - 1.2 * P))

# Solve automatically
known_variables = {"P": P, "D": D, "S": S}
thickness_result = equation.solve_for("t", known_variables)
print(f"Required thickness: {thickness_result.quantity}")

# Verify solution
assert equation.check_residual(known_variables) is True
```

### Import Strategy

Qnty provides a clean, minimal public API:

```python
# Preferred import style - clean public API
from qnty import Length, Pressure, Dimensionless

# Internal imports when needed for advanced usage
from qnty.variable import FastQuantity, TypeSafeVariable
from qnty.expression import Expression
from qnty.equation import Equation, EquationSystem
```
