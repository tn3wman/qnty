Rectangular solver needs to solve rectangular vector problems and rectangular report needs to generate the report on the steps taken to solve the rectangular vector problems. This should be quite similar to the existing code for parallelogram_solver.py and parallelogram_report.py. One difference is the parallelogram solver calls equations like law of sines and law of cosines, and gets standard formulas and steps for those. Rectangular solver won't necessarily use equations like that, but will use trigonometric relationships. The trig functions need to be able to either return solution steps, or a helper function needs to be created to generate solution steps for trig functions.

The steps for rectangular report should include something like this:
1. Calculate the components of each vector using trigonometric functions (sine and cosine).
    a. Something like:
        - F1 = {400 sin 30°(+ i) + 400 cos 30°( +j)} N = {200i +346j} N
        - F2 = {250 cos 45°(+ i) + 250 sin 45°( -j)} N = {177i- 177j} N
        - FR = F1 + F2 = {(200+177)i + (346-177)j} N = {377i + 169j} N
2. Calculate the magnitude of the resultant vector using the Pythagorean theorem.
    a. Something like:
        - |FR| = √(377^2 + 169^2) N = 415 N

3. Calculate the direction of the resultant vector using the inverse tangent function.
    a. Something like:
        - θ = tan^(-1)(FRy/FRx) = tan^(-1)(216/11.5) = 86.95°

Unknown angles should use the proper angle notation just like in the parallelogram report.

Work on solving problem 2-32 in C:\Projects\qnty\tests\statics\_problem_fixtures.py as the first test case for rectangular solver and rectangular report.
